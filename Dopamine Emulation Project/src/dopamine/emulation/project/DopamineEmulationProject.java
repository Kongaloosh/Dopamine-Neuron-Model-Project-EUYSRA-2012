 * Edited 21/12/12:
 * 
 *  Needed : 
 *      Timer -- For task switching and delays in the process -- just a gettime ()
 *      Actor -- Flesh out the tasks that are required
 *      Critic -- How are the constants derived and overall structure
 *      Some form of repository for sharing with other people (git?)
